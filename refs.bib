Furthermore, we compare its performance to benchmarking methods. The first dataset is composed by 16,000 simulated time series from a variety of Autoregressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average ({ARFIMA}) models. The second dataset consists of 135 mean annual temperature time series. The highest predictive performance of {RF} is observed when using a low number of recent lagged predictor variables. This outcome could be useful in relevant future applications, with the prospect to achieve higher predictive accuracy.},

As a precaution, the air pollution forecast is the basis for taking effective pollution control measures, and accurate forecasting of air pollution has become an important task. Extensive research indicates that the methods of air pollution forecasting can be broadly divided into three classical categories: statistical forecasting methods, artificial intelligence methods, and numerical forecasting methods. More recently, some hybrid models have been proposed, which can improve the forecast accuracy. To provide a clear perspective on air pollution forecasting, this study reviews the theory and application of those forecasting models. In addition, based on a comparison of different forecasting methods, the advantages and disadvantages of some methods of forecasting are also provided. This study aims to provide an overview of air pollution forecasting methods for easy access and reference by researchers, which will be helpful in further studies.},

	abstract = {The ultimate goal of regression analysis is to obtain information about the conditional distribution of a response given a set of explanatory variables. This goal is, however, seldom achieved because most established regression models estimate only the conditional mean as a function of the explanatory variables and assume that higher moments are not affected by the regressors. The underlying reason for such a restriction is the assumption of additivity of signal and noise. We propose to relax this common assumption in the framework of transformation models. The novel class of semiparametric regression models proposed herein allows transformation functions to depend on explanatory variables. These transformation functions are estimated by regularized optimization of scoring rules for probabilistic forecasts, e.g. the continuous ranked probability score. The corresponding estimated conditional distribution functions are consistent. Conditional transformation models are potentially useful for describing possible heteroscedasticity, comparing spatially varying distributions, identifying extreme events, deriving prediction intervals and selecting variables beyond mean regression effects. An empirical investigation based on a heteroscedastic varying-coefficient simulation model demonstrates that semiparametric estimation of conditional distribution functions can be more beneficial than kernel-based non-parametric approaches or parametric generalized additive models for location, scale and shape.},

However, when it comes to time series forecasting, because of the inherent serial correlation and potential non-stationarity of the data, its application is not straightforward and often replaced by practitioners in favour of an out-of-sample ({OOS}) evaluation. It is shown that for purely autoregressive models, the use of standard K-fold {CV} is possible provided the models considered have uncorrelated errors. Such a setup occurs, for example, when the models nest a more appropriate model. This is very common when Machine Learning methods are used for prediction, and where {CV} can control for overfitting the data. Theoretical insights supporting these arguments are presented, along with a simulation study and a real-world example. It is shown empirically that K-fold {CV} performs favourably compared to both {OOS} evaluation and other time-series-specific techniques such as non-dependent cross-validation.},

As a consequence, there may be a weak or no predictive relationship between the mean of the response variable (y) distribution and the measured predictive factors (X). Yet there may be stronger, useful predictive relationships with other parts of the response variable distribution.

The volatility transmission is closely associated with geographical proximity as well as with crisis periods which confirm the presence of contagion. The analysis of upper and lower quantiles allows observing that the interdependence increases during bullish markets while decreases during bearish markets. Accordingly, the structure of interdependence is asymmetric for both Asian and Latin American emerging markets.

However, the physiological mechanisms regarding mediate fatigue and the relationships between fatigue, cortisol and cytokines are unclear in patients with {HBV}. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between perceived fatigue, cortisol, and cytokines in Korean patients with {HBV}. The mean score for overall fatigue was moderate. In linear regression analyses, {TNF}-α was only significant as a predictor of fatigue. In quantile regression analyses, the cortisol level was significant in the 70th, 80th, 90th quantiles in the cognitive/mood fatigue subdimension, which correspond to severe levels of fatigue. {IL}-6 levels were significant in 90th quantile in overall fatigue and in the cognitive/mood fatigue subdimension. Cortisol, {IL}-6, and {TNF}- α were related to perceived fatigue in patients with {HBV}, particularly in the cognitive/mood dimension. This suggests that the fatigue patterns of patients with {HBV} are related to their mental and mood states and physical responses, such as cortisol and cytokine levels, are correlated with the nature of the fatigue. In the clinic, interventions to manage fatigue in patients with {HBV} should be developed based on the characteristics of the fatigue.},

Because wind power forecasting error is unavoidable, probabilistic forecasting becomes critical to accurately quantifying the uncertainty involved in traditional point forecasts of wind power and to providing meaningful information to conduct risk management in power system operation. This paper proposes a novel direct quantile regression approach to efficiently generate nonparametric probabilistic forecasting of wind power generation combining extreme learning machine and quantile regression. Quantiles with different proportions can be directly produced via an innovatively formulated linear programming optimization model, without dependency on point forecasts. Multistep probabilistic forecasting of 10-min wind power is newly carried out based on real wind farm data from Bornholm Island in Denmark. The superiority of the proposed approach is verified through comparisons with other well-established benchmarks. The proposed approach forms a new artificial neural network-based nonparametric forecasting framework for wind power with high efficiency, reliability, and flexibility, which can be beneficial to various decision-making activities in power systems.},

This paper discusses an application of partially linear additive quantile regression models for predicting short term electricity demand during the peak demand hours (i.e. from 18:00 to 20:00) using South African data for January 2009 to June 2012. Additionally the bounded variable mixed integer linear programming technique is used on the forecasts obtained in order to find an optimal number of units to commit (switch on or off. Variable selection is done using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. Results from the unit commitment problem show that it is very costly to use gas fired generating units. These were not selected as part of the optimal solution. It is shown that the optimal solutions based on median forecasts (Q0.5 quantile forecasts) are the same as those from the 99th quantile forecasts except for generating unit g8c, which is a coal fired unit. This shows that for any increase in demand above the median quantile forecasts it will be economical to increase the generation of electricity from generating unit g8c. The main contribution of this study is in the use of nonlinear trend variables and the combining of forecasting with the unit commitment problem. The study should be useful to system operators in power utility companies in the unit commitment scheduling and dispatching of electricity at a minimal cost particularly during the peak period when the grid is constrained due to increased demand for electricity.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes the use of the conditional quantile regression approach for the interpretation of the nonlinear relationships between daily maximum 1-h ozone concentrations and both meteorological and persistence information. When applied to eight years (1992–1999) of data from four monitoring sites in Athens, quantile regression results show that the contributions of the explanatory variables to the conditional distribution of the ozone concentrations vary significantly at different ozone regimes. This evidence of heterogeneity in the ozone values is hidden in an ordinary least-square regression that is confined to providing a single central tendency measure. Furthermore, the utilization of an ‘amalgated’ quantile regression model leads to a significantly improved goodness of fit at all sites. Finally, computation of conditional ozone densities through a simple quantile regression model allows the estimation of complete density distributions that can be used for forecasting next day's ozone concentrations under an uncertainty framework.},

	abstract = {More than 90\% of the sulfur dioxide in the air comes from human sources. Because of the adverse health effects of high levels of sulfur dioxide, specific regulations have been adopted to manage and reduce the amount of sulfur dioxide produced. However, some {SO}2 emission incidents (i.e. emission exceeding the limits established by law) still occur. The aim of this paper is to predict time series of {SO}2 concentrations in order to estimate in advance high emission episodes and analyse the influence of previous series in the prediction. Previous studies aimed to forecast {SO}2 pollution incidents are based on estimating mean values. Instead, we propose the use of quantile curves obtained from additive models as they provide not only the mean but also the whole distribution of the pollution levels. A backfitting algorithm with local polynomial kernel smoothers was used to estimate the model, and critical values of the hypothesis test were obtained by means of bootstrapping. The performance of the method was evaluated using simulated data as well as real data drawn from an {SO}2 time series of a coal-fired power station located in northern Spain.

	abstract = {A probabilistic forecast takes the form of a predictive probability distribution over future quantities or events of interest. Probabilistic forecasting aims to maximize the sharpness of the predictive distributions, subject to calibration, on the basis of the available information set. We formalize and study notions of calibration in a prediction space setting. In practice, probabilistic calibration can be checked by examining probability integral transform (PIT) histograms. Proper scoring rules such as the logarithmic score and the continuous ranked probability score serve to assess calibration and sharpness simultaneously. As a special case, consistent scoring functions provide decision-theoretically coherent tools for evaluating point forecasts. We emphasize methodological links to parametric and nonparametric distributional regression techniques, which attempt to model and to estimate conditional distribution functions; we use the context of statistically postprocessed ensemble forecasts in numerical weather prediction as an example. Throughout, we illustrate concepts and methodologies in data examples.},
