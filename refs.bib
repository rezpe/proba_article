  abstract =     {Air pollution is defined as a phenomenon harmful to
                  the ecological system and the normal conditions of
                  human existence and development when some substances
                  in the atmosphere exceed a certain concentration. In
                  the face of increasingly serious environmental
                  pollution problems, scholars have conducted a
                  significant quantity of related research, and in
                  those studies, the forecasting of air pollution has
                  been of paramount importance. As a precaution, the
                  air pollution forecast is the basis for taking
                  effective pollution control measures, and accurate
                  forecasting of air pollution has become an important
                  task. Extensive research indicates that the methods
                  of air pollution forecasting can be broadly divided
                  into three classical categories: statistical
                  forecasting methods, artificial intelligence
                  methods, and numerical forecasting methods. More
                  recently, some hybrid models have been proposed,
                  which can improve the forecast accuracy. To provide
                  a clear perspective on air pollution forecasting,
                  this study reviews the theory and application of
                  those forecasting models. In addition, based on a
                  comparison of different forecasting methods, the
                  advantages and disadvantages of some methods of
                  forecasting are also provided. This study aims to
                  provide an overview of air pollution forecasting
                  methods for easy access and reference by
                  researchers, which will be helpful in further
                  studies.},

                  1-h ozone concentrations and both meteorological and
                  persistence information. When applied to eight years
                  (1992–1999) of data from four monitoring sites in
                  Athens, quantile regression results show that the
                  contributions of the explanatory variables to the
                  conditional distribution of the ozone concentrations
                  vary significantly at different ozone regimes. This
                  evidence of heterogeneity in the ozone values is
                  hidden in an ordinary least-square regression that
                  is confined to providing a single central tendency
                  measure. Furthermore, the utilization of an
                  ‘amalgated’ quantile regression model leads to a
                  significantly improved goodness of fit at all
                  sites. Finally, computation of conditional ozone
                  densities through a simple quantile regression model
                  allows the estimation of complete density
                  distributions that can be used for forecasting next

                  evidence of significant interdependence between
                  financial markets which may give evidence of
                  volatility transmission. The volatility transmission
                  is closely associated with geographical proximity as

                  K-fold cross-validation ({CV}). However, when it
                  comes to time series forecasting, because of the
                  inherent serial correlation and potential
                  non-stationarity of the data, its application is not
                  straightforward and often replaced by practitioners
                  in favour of an out-of-sample ({OOS}) evaluation. It
                  is shown that for purely autoregressive models, the

  abstract =     {The energy industry has been going through a
                  significant modernization process over the last
                  decade. Its infrastructure is being upgraded
                  rapidly. The supply, demand and prices are becoming
                  more volatile and less predictable than ever
                  before. Even its business model is being challenged
                  fundamentally. In this competitive and dynamic
                  environment, many decision-making processes rely on
                  probabilistic forecasts to quantify the uncertain
                  future. Although most of the papers in the energy
                  forecasting literature focus on point or
                  single-valued forecasts, the research interest in
                  probabilistic energy forecasting research has taken
                  off rapidly in recent years. In this paper, we
                  summarize the recent research progress on
                  probabilistic energy forecasting. A major portion of
                  the paper is devoted to introducing the Global
                  Energy Forecasting Competition 2014 ({GEFCom}2014),

                  61 countries. We conclude the paper with 12

  abstract =     {The ultimate goal of regression analysis is to
                  obtain information about the conditional
                  distribution of a response given a set of
                  explanatory variables. This goal is, however, seldom
                  achieved because most established regression models
                  estimate only the conditional mean as a function of
                  the explanatory variables and assume that higher
                  moments are not affected by the regressors. The
                  underlying reason for such a restriction is the
                  assumption of additivity of signal and noise. We
                  propose to relax this common assumption in the
                  framework of transformation models. The novel class
                  of semiparametric regression models proposed herein
                  allows transformation functions to depend on
                  explanatory variables. These transformation
                  functions are estimated by regularized optimization
                  of scoring rules for probabilistic forecasts,
                  e.g. the continuous ranked probability score. The
                  corresponding estimated conditional distribution
                  functions are consistent. Conditional transformation
                  models are potentially useful for describing
                  possible heteroscedasticity, comparing spatially
                  varying distributions, identifying extreme events,
                  deriving prediction intervals and selecting
                  variables beyond mean regression effects. An
                  empirical investigation based on a heteroscedastic
                  varying-coefficient simulation model demonstrates
                  that semiparametric estimation of conditional
                  distribution functions can be more beneficial than
                  kernel-based non-parametric approaches or parametric
                  generalized additive models for location, scale and

                  and the relationships between fatigue, cortisol and

                  purpose of this study was to examine the
                  relationships between perceived fatigue, cortisol,
                  and cytokines in Korean patients with {HBV}. The
                  mean score for overall fatigue was moderate. In
                  linear regression analyses, {TNF}-α was only
                  significant as a predictor of fatigue. In quantile
                  regression analyses, the cortisol level was
                  significant in the 70th, 80th, 90th quantiles in the
                  cognitive/mood fatigue subdimension, which
                  correspond to severe levels of fatigue. {IL}-6
                  levels were significant in 90th quantile in overall
                  fatigue and in the cognitive/mood fatigue
                  subdimension. Cortisol, {IL}-6, and {TNF}- α were
                  related to perceived fatigue in patients with {HBV},
                  particularly in the cognitive/mood dimension. This
                  suggests that the fatigue patterns of patients with
                  {HBV} are related to their mental and mood states
                  and physical responses, such as cortisol and
                  cytokine levels, are correlated with the nature of
                  the fatigue. In the clinic, interventions to manage
                  fatigue in patients with {HBV} should be developed
                  based on the characteristics of the fatigue.},

These results permit a natural generalization of the linear model of certain well-known robust estimators of location. Estimators are suggested, which have comparable efficiency to least squares for Gaussian linear models while substantially out-performing the least-squares estimator over a wide class of non-Gaussian error distributions.},

                  paper discusses an application of partially linear

                  short term electricity demand during the peak demand
                  hours (i.e. from 18:00 to 20:00) using South African
                  data for January 2009 to June 2012. Additionally the
                  bounded variable mixed integer linear programming
                  technique is used on the forecasts obtained in order
                  to find an optimal number of units to commit (switch
                  on or off. Variable selection is done using the
                  least absolute shrinkage and selection
                  operator. Results from the unit commitment problem
                  show that it is very costly to use gas fired
                  generating units. These were not selected as part of
                  the optimal solution. It is shown that the optimal
                  solutions based on median forecasts (Q0.5 quantile
                  forecasts) are the same as those from the 99th
                  quantile forecasts except for generating unit g8c,
                  which is a coal fired unit. This shows that for any
                  increase in demand above the median quantile
                  forecasts it will be economical to increase the
                  generation of electricity from generating unit
                  g8c. The main contribution of this study is in the
                  use of nonlinear trend variables and the combining
                  of forecasting with the unit commitment problem. The
                  study should be useful to system operators in power

                  comes from human sources. Because of the adverse
                  health effects of high levels of sulfur dioxide,
                  specific regulations have been adopted to manage and
                  reduce the amount of sulfur dioxide
                  produced. However, some {SO}2 emission incidents
                  (i.e. emission exceeding the limits established by
                  law) still occur. The aim of this paper is to
                  predict time series of {SO}2 concentrations in order
                  to estimate in advance high emission episodes and
                  analyse the influence of previous series in the
                  prediction. Previous studies aimed to forecast {SO}2
                  pollution incidents are based on estimating mean
                  values. Instead, we propose the use of quantile

                  not only the mean but also the whole distribution of
                  the pollution levels. A backfitting algorithm with
                  local polynomial kernel smoothers was used to
                  estimate the model, and critical values of the
                  hypothesis test were obtained by means of
                  bootstrapping. The performance of the method was

                  aims to predict the probabilistic distribution of

                  algorithm is adapted for this probabilistic
                  forecasting task. It allows quantiles to be
                  estimated without requiring assumptions as to the
                  probability distribution. The influences of several
                  factors (wind speed, wind direction and hour) on the
                  normalized wind power are investigated. The
                  feasibility of the approach is demonstrated through

                  algorithms has gained popularity recently. Random
                  forest is a machine learning algorithm implemented

                  forecasting properties have remained

                  series with the aim to suggest an optimal set of

                  performance to benchmarking methods. The first
                  dataset is composed by 16,000 simulated time series
                  from a variety of Autoregressive Fractionally

                  generation bring severe challenges to secure and

                  power forecasting error is unavoidable,
                  probabilistic forecasting becomes critical to
                  accurately quantifying the uncertainty involved in

                  providing meaningful information to conduct risk

                  proposes a novel direct quantile regression approach
                  to efficiently generate nonparametric probabilistic

                  extreme learning machine and quantile

	abstract = {We present Natural Gradient Boosting ({NGBoost}), an algorithm which brings probabilistic prediction capability to gradient boosting in a generic way. Predictive uncertainty estimation is crucial in many applications such as healthcare and weather forecasting. Probabilistic prediction, which is the approach where the model outputs a full probability distribution over the entire outcome space, is a natural way to quantify those uncertainties. Gradient Boosting Machines have been widely successful in prediction tasks on structured input data, but a simple boosting solution for probabilistic prediction of real valued outputs is yet to be made. {NGBoost} is a gradient boosting approach which uses the {\textbackslash}emph\{Natural Gradient\} to address technical challenges that makes generic probabilistic prediction hard with existing gradient boosting methods. Our approach is modular with respect to the choice of base learner, probability distribution, and scoring rule. We show empirically on several regression datasets that {NGBoost} provides competitive predictive performance of both uncertainty estimates and traditional metrics.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1804.02921},
	abstract = {To obtain a probabilistic model for a dependent variable based on some set of explanatory variables, a distributional approach is often adopted where the parameters of the distribution are linked to regressors. In many classical models this only captures the location of the distribution but over the last decade there has been increasing interest in distributional regression approaches modeling all parameters including location, scale, and shape. Notably, so-called non-homogeneous Gaussian regression ({NGR}) models both mean and variance of a Gaussian response and is particularly popular in weather forecasting. Moreover, generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape ({GAMLSS}) provide a framework where each distribution parameter is modeled separately capturing smooth linear or nonlinear effects. However, when variable selection is required and/or there are non-smooth dependencies or interactions (especially unknown or of high-order), it is challenging to establish a good {GAMLSS}. A natural alternative in these situations would be the application of regression trees or random forests but, so far, no general distributional framework is available for these. Therefore, a framework for distributional regression trees and forests is proposed that blends regression trees and random forests with classical distributions from the {GAMLSS} framework as well as their censored or truncated counterparts. To illustrate these novel approaches in practice, they are employed to obtain probabilistic precipitation forecasts at numerous sites in a mountainous region based on a large number of numerical weather prediction quantities. It is shown that the novel distributional regression forests automatically select variables and interactions, performing on par or often even better than {GAMLSS} specified either through prior meteorological knowledge or a computationally more demanding boosting approach.},

The proposed mechanism is evaluated on a large-scale database built by the Environmental Protection Administration, and Central Weather Bureau, Taiwan, which includes data from 77 air monitoring stations and 580 weather stations performing hourly measurements over 1 year. By learning from past records of {PM}2.5 and neighboring weather stations’ climatic information, the forecasting model works well for 24-h prediction at most air stations. This study also investigates the geographical and meteorological divergence for the forecasting results of seven regional monitoring areas. We also compare the prediction performance between Taiwan, Taipei, and London; analyze the impact of industrial pollution; and propose an enhanced version of the prediction model to improve the prediction accuracy. The results indicate that Taipei and London have similar prediction results because these two cities have similar topography (basin) and are financial centers without domestic pollution sources. The results also suggest that after considering industrial impacts by incorporating additional features from the Taichung and Thong-Siau power plants, the proposed method achieves significant improvement in the coefficient of determination (R2) from 0.58 to 0.71. Moreover, for Taichung City the root-mean-square error decreases from 8.56 for the conventional approach to 7.06 for the proposed method.},

Notably Beijing is one of the most polluted capitals in the world. Hence, the focus of the study area is on Beijing. In the first stage, we analyze spatial and temporal characteristics of air pollution of the 6 cities while in the second stage the Granger causality test is applied to investigate whether air pollution of a city is affected by its neighbors, and vice versa. The findings are the following. Overall, {AQI} values are high in winter and early spring while low in summer and autumn. Among the 6 cities, Baoding is the major contributor to air pollution in this entire area. Besides, Granger causality test results show that there is a unidirectional relationship running from Baoding to Beijing and a bidirectional relationship between Beijing and Tianjin. In other words, apart from local air pollutants, for example, exhaust gas, air quality of Beijing is affected by air pollution of Tianjin, and vice versa. However, regarding the relationship between Beijing and Baoding, air quality of Beijing is just affected by air pollution of Baoding, since Baoding is much polluted than Beijing.},
